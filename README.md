# Donut

just a simple tool that generates a circos plot from a bunch of fasta files

# usuage
0. the input files schould be named like `$genome_$sample.fasta` and the input fasta files should have the following header formt: `>contig-$number`
1. clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/philippmuench/Donut.git`
2. put your fasta (one or multipe) files in the `data/genomes/` folder
3. add your Hidden Markov model file to `data/hmm/model.hmm`
4. start the docker container `docker run -v /absolute/path/to/data/folder:/data philippmuench/donut`
5. inspect the output written to `data/output/`

# example output
![image](data/output/comp_2.png)

from outer to inner:
- GC content
- gene density (black), hypothetical gene density (red)
- match to HMM models against ORFs
- links: similar ORF by blast
- colored links: similar ORFs that cover full a HMM match 

# development

comment the entrypoint in `Dockerfile` out than build the docker image from scatch

```
sudo docker build -t donut .
```

then start in interactive mode

```
sudo docker run -it -v /home/pmuench/github.com/philippmuench/easycircos/data:/data donut
```

inside the docker image start the tool

```
./start.sh
```

The error print to screen are not critical, becaused the hmmvis tool tries to export png image to the screen which is not possible within docker. 

You can also change `data/config/circos.config` file from outside the container (because its mounted to the image) and run the circos step only to update the output file 

```
./start_circos.sh
```
